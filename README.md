# A Study of Urban Perception and Geometric Factor
College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, blairdahuang@outlook.com
# ABSTRACT 
A series of recent paper (Fan Zhang et al 2018, Abhimanyu Dubey et al 2016,  Sean M. Arietta et al 2014) have presented state-of-the-art computer vision models to validate urban visual appearance, which allows the urban quantitative analysis to look beyond not only geometry feature but also the urban perception dimension. 

Taking the Anshan New Village as the research object, this paper begins using segment analysis to find out the choice and integration of network. To find out how streets with different choice and integration differ in visual appearance, I trained an image classification model based on convolutional neural network, which would measure the impression of the object area. 

Moreover, after matching the vitality score with space syntax indicator, a correlation analysis to identify the relationship of perception and geometric factors indicates that there are no strong correlation among them. Then, I used Gaussian Mixture Model to classify clusters of streets to extract features, which gives new classification method of streets. The research results can be further used to instruct street renewal based on the design concept.

# About Me
My name is Huang Zhuoya. I'm currently in my final year in Tongji University studying urban planning. I'm really interested in urban tech. Hopefully, I will learn computer science in the next two years.
